# olist-ecommerce-sql-analysis
SQL-based exploratory analysis of the Brazilian Olist e-commerce dataset using Google BigQuery.
## 1. Project Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Brazilian Olist e-commerce dataset using SQL in Google BigQuery. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, sales performance, delivery efficiency, and customer satisfaction through structured SQL queries.

The project focuses on applying core SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, and time-based analysis to extract meaningful business insights from a real-world relational dataset. It was developed as a portfolio project to demonstrate practical SQL and analytical skills.

## 2. Dataset Description

The analysis is based on the Brazilian Olist e-commerce public dataset, which contains real transactional data from an online marketplace.

The dataset includes multiple relational tables covering different aspects of the e-commerce process, such as:
- Customers and their geographic information
- Orders and order status lifecycle
- Order items and product details
- Sellers and seller locations
- Payments and payment methods
- Customer reviews and satisfaction scores

The data spans from 2016 to 2018 and represents thousands of orders placed across Brazil, making it suitable for analyzing customer behavior, sales performance, delivery efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
